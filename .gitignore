# After your first big deploy and all of your files are already
# on your web host you could uncomment the following items
# app/wp-content/uploads/
# app/wp-admin
# app/wp-includes

# You could also list the indidivual WordPress system files that
# live in the root of our folder, for example, here are just a few
# app/index.php
# app/license.txt
# app/readme.html
# app/wp-activate.php
# app/wp-blog-header.php
# so on and so forth


# Here is an example of how you could ignore the plugins folder
# and then use the exclamation point to un-ignore only certain plugins
# that do not auto-update and that you DO want to keep in Git.
# app/wp-content/plugins/
# !app/wp-content/plugins/advanced-custom-fields-pro/
